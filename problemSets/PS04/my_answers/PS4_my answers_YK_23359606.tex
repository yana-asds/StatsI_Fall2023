\noindent 	
In this question, use the \texttt{prestige} dataset in the \texttt{car} library. First, run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
install.packages(car)
library(car)
data(Prestige)
help(Prestige)
\end{verbatim} 


\noindent We would like to study whether individuals with higher levels of income have more prestigious jobs. Moreover, we would like to study whether professionals have more prestigious jobs than blue and white collar workers.

	Create a new variable \texttt{professional} by recoding the variable \texttt{type} so that professionals are coded as $1$, and blue and white collar workers are coded as $0$ (Hint: \texttt{ifelse}).
	
	\noindent \textbf After loading \texttt{Prestige} dataset into the working environment, I used summary() method to display summary statistics of each variable in the dataset. \vspace{0.5cm}

\section*{Question 2: Political Science}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent 	Researchers are interested in learning the effect of all of those yard signs on voting preferences.\footnote{Donald P. Green, Jonathan	S. Krasno, Alexander Coppock, Benjamin D. Farrer,	Brandon Lenoir, Joshua N. Zingher. 2016. ``The effects of lawn signs on vote outcomes: Results from four randomized field experiments.'' Electoral Studies 41: 143-150. } Working with a campaign in Fairfax County, Virginia, 131 precincts were randomly divided into a treatment and control group. In 30 precincts, signs were posted around the precinct that read, ``For Sale: Terry McAuliffe. Don't Sellout Virgina on November 5.'' \\

Below is the result of a regression with two variables and a constant.  The dependent variable is the proportion of the vote that went to McAuliff's opponent Ken Cuccinelli. The first variable indicates whether a precinct was randomly assigned to have the sign against McAuliffe posted. The second variable indicates
a precinct that was adjacent to a precinct in the treatment group (since people in those precincts might be exposed to the signs).  \\

	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient for the constant term substantively.
	\vspace{0.5 cm}
	
	\noindent In regression analysis, the constant term is the estimated \textit{y}-intercept that represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero. Thus, constant term $ \beta_0 $ = 0.302 represents the estimated average proportion of the vote that went to McAuliff’s opponent Ken Cuccinelli in the absence of lawn signs assigned and adjacent to.
	\vspace{0.5 cm}
	
	\item [(d)] Evaluate the model fit for this regression.  What does this	tell us about the importance of yard signs versus other factors that are not modeled?
	
	\noindent The correlation r and its square describe the strength of association between y and the set of explanatory variables acting together as predictors in the model. $ R^{2} $ falls between 0 and 1. The larger the value of $ R^{2} $, the better the set of explanatory variables $ (\text{x}_1, . . . , \text{x}_p) $ collectively predicts \textit{y} (Agresti, 2018, section 11.2 Multiple Correlation and $ R^{2} $ ). Our $ R^{2} $ = 0.094, it is small, thus, we could suggest that the included variables do not provide the better explaination of the proportion of the vote that went to McAuliff’s opponent Ken Cuccinelli. The other factors that are not modeled could be significant.
